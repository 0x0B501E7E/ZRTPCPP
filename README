This package provides a library that adds ZRTP support to the GNU
ccRTP stack. Phil Zimmermann developed ZRTP to allow ad-hoc, easy to
use key negotiation to setup Secure RTP (SRTP) sessions. GNU ZRTP
together with GNU ccRTP (1.5.0 or later) provides a ZRTP
implementation that can be directly embedded into client and server
applications.

The GNU ZRTP implementation is compliant to the basic functions of
ZRTP as described in ''RFC6189''. Currently GNU ZRTP supports the basic
features, multi-stream mode, various Diffie-Helman algorithms (standard
and elliptic curve) and it supports optional symmetrical crypto algorithms
(TwoFish) and Skein hash and Skein MAC algorithms.

Enhanced features like PBX SAS relay or preshared mode are not supported but
the GNU ZRTP implementation defines the necessary external interfaces and 
functions for these enhanced features (stubs only).

The first application to demonstrate this capability was the 0.8.2 release 
of the Twinkle softphone client. All following versions of Twinkle support
GNU ZRTP as well.

later, and has been copyright assigned to the Free Software Foundation.
